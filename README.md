## Introduction
The User Catalog project is a web application built using Angular (HTTP Concepts)that displays a list of users and their details fetched from **[Random User Generator][1]**. This project is designed / created to demonstrate my knowledge of Angular HTTP requests. The requested data was manipulated / transformed using RXJS map operator. The following concepts were used to create this application:

+ Angular Components
+ Components Data Binding
  + String Interpolation
  + Property Binding
  + Event Binding
+ Components Lifecycle
+ Angular Directives
  + Built-in Directives
  + Structural Directives
+ Angular Services
+ Angular resolver
+ Angular Pipes
  + Date Pipe
+ Angular Routing
  + Router Configuration
  + Router Parameters
  + Activated Routes
  + Router Outlet
+ RxJs
  + Observables
  + Map Operator
+ [Leaflet Map](https://leafletjs.com/ "A Javascript open-source library for mobile-friendly interactive maps")

**Note:** This project does not perform the full CRUD operations, it only reads and imitates the update operation. The API used does not support Create, Update, and Delete operations
